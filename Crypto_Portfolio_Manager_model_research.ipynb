        "1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a financial model used to construct an optimal investment portfolio by balancing return and risk.\n",
        "It was developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952 and later earned him a Nobel Prize in Economics.\n",
        "\n",
        "MPT is widely used in financial markets to determine how investors can diversify their investments to achieve maximum return with minimum risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this Crypto Investment Manager project, MPT is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculate the best mix of crypto assets\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduce overall portfolio risk\n",

        "\n",
        "Modern Portfolio Theory works on the principle of diversification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of investing in a single asset, MPT combines multiple assets such as:\n",

        "Ethereum\n",
