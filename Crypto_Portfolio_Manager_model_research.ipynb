        "\n",
        "Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this Crypto Investment Manager project, Decision Tree is used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "Predict Buy / Sell / Hold signals\n",
        "\n",
        "Classify crypto assets into Low, Medium, or High risk\n",
        "\n",
        "Support rule-based investment decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "It is simple, interpretable, and easy to implement using Python libraries like:\n",

        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree works by splitting data based on feature conditions.\n",

        "Root Node → Entire dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "Decision Nodes → Conditions (e.g., volatility > 5%)\n",
        "\n",
        "Leaf Nodes → Final prediction (BUY / SELL / HOLD)\n",
        "\n",

        "Entropy\n",
        "\n",
        "Information Gain\n",
